For Admin access:

1. Don't run initialise_db.py
2. Create folder called: instance
3. Drag restaurantmenu.db into newly created folder
4. Login with Details below:

Username: AdminAccount
Password: Comp3130

Didn't add the restaurant owner role, which would be similar to the regular user role,
but would have access to editing the menu for their own restaurant and maybe a few other things.

Admin accounts have extra privileges compared to a regular account which they wouldn't have access to; Admins can also access the admin dashboard to add and revoke the admin role for accounts.

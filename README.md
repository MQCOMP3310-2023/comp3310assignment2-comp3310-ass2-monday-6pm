Didnt add restaurant owner role which would be Similar to regular user role,
but would have access to editing the menu for their own restaurant and maybe a few other things.

Admin account as extra priveldges that a regular account wouldnt have access too, they can also access the admin dashboard to add and revoke the admin role to accounts.
